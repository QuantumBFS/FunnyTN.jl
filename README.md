Pictograph for tensor networks in quantum computing.

See our funny [proposal](docs/src/dev/proposal.md) of utf-8 based design.

**FunnyNN is in progress!**

## To Develop/Run Tests
`]` enter Pkg mode, type `dev git@github.com:QuantumBFS/FunnyTN.jl.git`.
In the same Pkg mode, type `test FunnyTN` to run tests.

The project folder is `~/.julia/dev/FunnyTN`.

## WHY WE USE THE 1000COKE LICENSE IN THIS REPO
Open sourse licenses often emphasis open and free at the same time.
But "open and free" is also harmful to the diversity of software industry.
This "1000COKE" license allows an opensource software to triger a payment when they are used to make profit in commerial events.

To most developers, this license is the same as MIT license.
However, to intemediate/big companies that use the software in commercial events and make a win, it matters.

This license is able to
1. encourage software startups
2. prevent "pirating" opensource softwares (it is strange if someone can sell slightly modified open source software to users without feedback to original developer!)
3. encourage better open source quality (open source software can never beat the closed counterpart, since they can always inspect your functions and write a better one!).
